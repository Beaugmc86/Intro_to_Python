# Task 1.2 - Data Types in Python

## Objectives

- Explain variables and data types in Python.
- Summarize the use of objects in Python.
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app.

## Task Responses

1.1 For the created structure "recipe_1," decide what data structure you would use and explain why you've chosen it.

- I chose to use dictionaries data structures for each of my recipes. Dictionaries allow for flexiblility in what type data needs to be stored, whether they're strings or integers. Additionally, one of the key attributes of dictionaries is they're mutable and can be updated in the future if needed.

  1.3 For the outer structure "all_recipes," What type of structure would you consider and briefly note your justification.

- For the "all_recipes" outer structure, I chose to create a list to store the recipe dictionaries. I chose this structure as they can easily store data like a truple, but are also mutable and can be modified or deleted as needed, allowing for greater flexibility.
